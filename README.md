The C Programming language 1978

> _"C is a general-purpose programming language which features economy of expression, modern control flow and data structures, and a rich set of operators. C is not a "very high level" language, nor a "big" one, and is not specialized to any particular area of application. But its absence of restrictions and its generality make it more convenient and effective for many tasks than supposedly more powerful languages."_

> _"In our experience, C has proven to be a pleasant, expressive, and versatile language for a wide variety of programs. It is easy to learn, and it wears well as one's experience with it grows"_

The C Programming language Second Edition 1988

> _"As we said in the preface to the first edition, C "wears well as one's experience with it grows." With a decade more experience, we still feel that way."_




# üç∞ Cake

Cake is a compiler front end written from scratch in C, designed from the C23 language specification.
It allows you to translate newer versions of C, such as C23, to C99. Additionally, Cake provides a platform 
for experimenting with new features for the C language, including extensions like lambdas, defer and static [object lifetime](ownership.md) checks.


# Web Playground

This is the best way to try.

http://thradams.com/cake/playground.html

# Use cases

If you have a project that is distributed with code, you don't need to limit the project development at the lower supported language version.  For instance, you can use attributes like *nodiscard* during the development or *defer*, both features 
improving the code security. Then adding a extra step in your build you can distribute a readable C99 source code that compiles everywhere.
Cake can also be used as static analyzer, especially the new object lifetime analysis.

# Features

* C23 preprocessor
* C23 syntax analysis
* C23 semantic analysis
* Static [object lifetime](ownership.md) checks (Extension)
* Sarif output
* C backend
* AST 
* So far, 34 preprocessor diagnostics, 236 compiler diagnostics


# Build

GitHub 
https://github.com/thradams/cake

## MSVC build instructions
Open the Developer Command Prompt of visual studio. Go to the *src* directory and type

```
cl build.c && build
```

This will build *cake.exe*, then run cake on its own source code.


## GCC on Linux build instructions
Got to the *src* directory and type:

```
gcc build.c -o build && ./build
```

## Clang on Linux/Windows/MacOS build instructions
Got to the *src* directory and type:

```
clang build.c -o build && ./build
```


To run unit tests windows/linux add *-DTEST* for instance:

```
gcc -DTEST build.c -o build && ./build
```

## Emscripten build instructions (web)

Emscripten https://emscripten.org/  is required. 

First do the normal build. 

The normal build also generates a file *lib.c* that is the amalgamated  version of the "core lib".

Then at _./src_ dir type:

```
call emcc -DMOCKFILES "lib.c" -o "Web\cake.js" -s WASM=0 -s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS="['_CompileText']" -s EXTRA_EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS="['ccall', 'cwrap']"
```

This will generate the *\src\Web\cake.js*


# Running cake at command line

Make sure cake is on your system path.

Samples

```
cake source.c
```

this will output *./out/source.c*

See [Manual](manual.md)

# How cake is developed?

I am using Visual Studio 2022 IDE to write/debug cake source. Cake is parsing itself using
the includes of MSVC and it generates the *out* dir after build. 

I use Visual Studio code with WSL for testing and compiling the code for Linux.

Cake source code is not using any extension so the output is the same of input. 
This compilation is useful for tracking errors together with the unit tests.

# Differences  from CFront

CFront was the original compiler for C++, designed to convert C++ code into C.  

The code generated by CFront was used solely for direct compilation because 
it had all macros expanded, making the generated output unsuitable for 
reuse on other platforms.  

Cake offers two modes. The first is for direct compilation, similar to CFront.
The second mode preserves macros, includes, and other preprocessor directives,
making the output suitable for distribution.

Another key difference is that C++ represents a separate 
evolutionary branch, maintaining greater compatibility with C89 
than with C99.  

The goal of Cake is to follow the main evolutionary line of C and remain 
100% compatible with C.  

The added extensions aim to uphold the spirit of the language while allowing 
developers to experiment with proposed features even before they become standardized.
